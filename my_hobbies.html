<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>Swimming is a passion of mine. I love Photography and Movies. Also, being happy is a state of mind, so I like helping people in need and seeing them happy. Nevertheless, I dislike when others are mean to each other. In Fact, I hate racism, mannerism and lies. I enjoy the simple things in life, and I always look toward the next best thing.
