<h1>My Family</h1>
<p>
    I love my parents, yet I have a special love with my mom because I spent almost all of my childhood with her. As my father died when I was 8 years, she was a mother, father, and all my family. On one side, I have a big family-many siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces. On the other side, I have my older sister. She helped me a lot, and she is always doing so. In addition, she gives me a lot of hopes in this life.</p>
